## Incident Summary

<!-- What happened in production? Include date, severity, and user impact. -->

## Root Cause

<!-- Why did this happen? What was the underlying defect? -->

## What Should Have Caught It

Which harness layer should have prevented this regression?

- [ ] Pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Risk policy gate
- [ ] CI pipeline (lint / type-check / test / build)
- [ ] Review agent
- [ ] Browser evidence
- [ ] Architectural linter (boundary violations)
- [ ] Structural tests (harness smoke)
- [ ] Other: ___

## Proposed Harness Improvement

<!-- What specific check, test, rule, or gate should be added or strengthened? -->

## Affected Critical Paths

<!-- Which paths from harness.config.json are affected? Check all that apply. -->

- [ ] `src/index.ts`
- [ ] `package.json`
- [ ] `tsconfig.json`
- [ ] `eslint.config.js`
- [ ] None of the above (new critical path needed)

## SLO Target

- [ ] **P0**: Within 24 hours (active production breakage)
- [ ] **P1**: Within 1 week (high-risk gap, could recur)
- [ ] **P2**: Within 1 sprint (medium-risk, workaround exists)
- [ ] **P3**: Next planning cycle (low-risk, defense-in-depth)

## Test Case Specification

Describe the test that would catch this regression going forward:

- **Input / preconditions**: <!-- e.g., "A PR that modifies src/string-utils.ts without updating tests" -->
- **Expected behavior**: <!-- e.g., "CI fails at test step" -->
- **Actual behavior**: <!-- e.g., "PR merged without catching the bug" -->
- **Files to test**: <!-- e.g., "src/string-utils.ts, tests/string-utils.test.ts" -->

## Evidence

<!-- Links to incident reports, error logs, screenshots, or related PRs/issues. -->

> **Process**: After filing this issue, add a priority label (`P0`/`P1`/`P2`/`P3`) and update [docs/harness-gaps.md](../../docs/harness-gaps.md). See the [incident-to-harness loop process](../../docs/harness-gaps.md#process) for next steps.
